# üéâ Decentraland Venue Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Decentraland Venue Starter Kit** ‚Äî a plug-and-play scene template designed to jumpstart the creation of your own virtual club, gallery, or event space. Built on **M1D Components**, it delivers powerful features while letting you focus on what matters most: your creativity.

This scene comes pre-configured with a **network-synced video screen** and a **vibrant animated dance floor**, making it the perfect foundation for a polished, functional venue‚Äîno need to start from scratch.

## üß© Features at a Glance

- **VideoGuide Component**  
  A fully integrated video system that connects to a shared content network. It includes a user-friendly channel selector UI and supports synchronized playback across scenes using the same component.

- **CurvedScreen Component**  
  A procedurally generated curved display optimized for immersive viewing.

- **Animated Dance Floor**  
  An eye-catching shader-powered floor that cycles through a pastel palette to energize your space.

- **Single Parcel Layout**  
  Clean, optimized geometry designed to perfectly fit a 16x16m parcel.

## üß† Core Logic ‚Äì `src/index.ts`

The heart of the scene is beautifully simple, powered by two function calls from the `@m1d/dcl-components` library:

```ts
import { createCurvedScreen, createVideoGuide } from '@m1d/dcl-components';

export async function main() {
  const videoGuide = await createVideoGuide();

  createCurvedScreen({
    position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8),
    rotation: Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 0, 0),
    scale: Vector3.create(1, 1, 1),
    videoTexture: videoGuide.videoTexture
  });

  // Additional assets like the ground and dance floor load here...
}
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Customization

Make the scene your own:

- **Swap Models**: Replace `ground1Parcel.glb` or `DF_WithSpinning_Shuffle_Float2.glb` with your own.
- **Reposition Elements**: Tweak `position`, `rotation`, or `scale` values in `src/index.ts`.
- **Add Logic & Interactives**: Expand `main()` with your own code, models, or behavior.

This kit gives you the foundation‚Äîyou bring the vision.
